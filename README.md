# NFLPicker
Gives a very rough estimate for the winner of NFL games.
Values are technically associated with points to win by but are not very accurate at this point.
Adding more data and analysis to make better predictions in the future.
Program should be able to recognize the current week and grab the select slate of games.
Running this while games are being played or have already been played will not produce desired result.
